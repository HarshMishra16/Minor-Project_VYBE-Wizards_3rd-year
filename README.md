# AI-Powered Women Safety Application

This repository contains the specification, prototypes, and deployment artifacts for an AI-powered women safety application that detects voice distress, supports NLP emergency chat, and generates concise emergency summaries.

Core components:
- Mobile app (Flutter) — audio capture, local inference, chat UI
- Backend (FastAPI) — alerting, NLP processing, LLM summary orchestration
- Models — voice distress detection, intent classification, NER
- Data & annotation pipelines — dataset specs and augmentation scripts

Getting started:
1. Review `architecture.md` for system design.
2. See `dataset_spec.md` for dataset collection and labelling.
3. Use the `fastapi/` and `flutter/` folders (to be added) for service and client code.

Privacy & legal:
- Users must opt-in to audio monitoring.
- Raw audio retention must be minimized and encrypted.
