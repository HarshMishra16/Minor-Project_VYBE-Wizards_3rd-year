AI-Powered Women Safety Application Using Voice Distress Detection, NLP Emergency Chat, and Generative AI
 

Problem Description
Women face increasing safety challenges in public and private spaces, especially during travel, late hours, or isolated situations. In many emergency scenarios, victims are unable to manually call for help or clearly explain their situation due to panic, fear, or physical constraints. Traditional safety applications rely heavily on manual SOS buttons or phone calls, which may not be effective in real-time distress situations.

Additionally, emergency response systems often receive unstructured and incomplete information, making it difficult for police or emergency services to quickly assess the severity of the situation and take immediate action. There is also a lack of intelligent systems that can automatically understand distress from voice, analyze emergency messages, and provide concise situational summaries for faster decision-making.

Hence, there is a need for an intelligent, automated, and AI-powered women safety system that can detect distress situations proactively, enable seamless communication with authorities, and deliver accurate location-based emergency information in real time.
Objectives
To develop an AI-based women safety system capable of detecting distress from voice signals using Deep Learning.
To enable real-time emergency communication with police through an NLP-based intelligent chat system.
To generate concise, human-readable emergency and location summaries using Generative AI for faster response.
To provide live location tracking and automated alert mechanisms during emergency situations.
To reduce response time and improve situational awareness for law enforcement agencies.

Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is an AI-Powered Women Safety Application that integrates Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative AI to provide real-time emergency detection and response.

The system uses a Deep Learning-based voice distress detection module that continuously analyzes short voice samples to identify panic or distress emotions. When distress is detected, the system automatically triggers an emergency alert without requiring manual intervention.

An NLP-based emergency chat system allows users to send text messages to the police or emergency services. The NLP engine analyzes the message to identify intent, urgency, and critical entities such as location or threat type, ensuring accurate understanding of the situation.

A Generative AI module processes distress signals, chat content, and GPS location data to generate a concise, human-readable emergency summary. This summary helps law enforcement quickly understand the situation and take prompt action.
